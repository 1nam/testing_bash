i was asked this question what code should i learn? honestly im still learning i dont think you ever stop learning 
code is in constant change.
just test them all is my aproch to coding find what your good at and enjoy doing it.
spring and summer i spend alot of time on windows fall and winter i go to linux.
this keeps things fresh
when im on windows code geared towards windows
linux i code geared towards linux
learning the way two operating systems handle things 
can help in coding
when you see a huge script someone made dont think you cant do it just takes time to learn.
start small the more you code every day the more your code will grow in size it becomes easy.
dont just copy and paste code and reorganize it to your benifit learn what each symbol means why it was coded that way.
look at how code is layed out how many spaces before a { was placed.
if you get frustated walk away from it come back fresh keep an open mind use common sense and logic.
