Learning Bash Linux Terminal
using Linux Mint Cinnamon 64bit
using default terminal
using built in nano text editor

a nice feature in linux mint is right clicking the top of a window and choosing to keep it on top of other windows 
this allows you to be able to use terminal or a text editor all while on a movie or social media or writing webpages.

crtl + alt + t #opens terminal use arrow keys up down to view past terminal commands
if your not sure what a command means or does type :  man --help  or   man and the command   man is the manual pages of terminal.

nano file_3    #opens nano text editor within terminal and gives file name file_3
^O        at the bottom of nano you will see this symbol ^ this means hold ctrl key down on keyboard.
          so ^O means ctrl + o will save your file.
